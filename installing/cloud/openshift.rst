Openshift PaaS
===========

Notice
---------------------------------------
A quickstart has been made to handle much of the below by using openshift's environment variables. If you're just getting started please take a look at `ahwayakchih's openshift repo <https://github.com/ahwayakchih/openshift-nodebb>`_

The following are installation instructions for the `Openshift <http://openshift.com>`_ PaaS. Before starting, you need to install Red Hat's rhc command line at `https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-client-tools.html <https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-client-tools.html>`_

**Step 1:** Create an application:

You may do this through `your web console <https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/applications>`_ or by using rhc:

.. code:: bash
	
	rhc app create nodebb nodejs-0.10

If you're using the web console:

Scroll down and choose Node.js 0.10 in "Other types". Then click 'Next'. Type `nodebb` in application name or replace `(name)` to whatever you like. 

You may see a note indicating you need to specify a namespace. Namespace can be anything as long you do not change the application name. If you do add a namespace make sure to use them in your RHC commands with -n and use -a to target you application by name.

.. code:: bash
	
	rhc app create -a nodebb -n mynamespace nodejs-0.10

Scroll all the way down and click 'Create Application'. Then you need to wait for it to finish creating your first NodeBB application.

You will be asked if you want to code your application. Simply click 'Not now, contiune'. Then you will be redirected to an application page. It will tell you that it is created without any errors and it is started.

**Step 2:** Add a Database:

NodeBB works with eaither Redis or MongoDB, we'll use MongoDB.

.. code:: bash

	rhc cartridge add mongodb-2.4 -a nodebb

In the web console:	

Click 'see the list of cartridges you can add'. Choose the MongoDB cartridge. Then click 'Next'. You should see if you want to confirm. Click 'Add Cartridge'.

**Step 3:** Note your Database Credentials. 

After installing the cartridge you'll get a notification of your username and password. Write it down somewhere, as you will need it later.

Open terminal (or Git Bash) and paste the following command to access SSH.

.. code:: bash

	rhc app ssh -a nodebb


Note: If you got an error that it does not exist or similar, you need to do the following command and then try again.

.. code:: bash

	rhc setup

Get your Database's Host, IP and Port 

Save this for later as well...

.. code:: bash

	echo $OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP && echo $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_HOST && echo $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PORT

In order:
First line: NodeJS IP address - You should save it.
Second line: Mongodb IP address - Write it down.
Third line: Mongodb Port - Write it down.

Now exit SSH by pasting the following command.

.. code:: bash

	exit

Note: You might have to type 'exit' once, and then again to exit SSH completely.

**Step 4:** Add NodeBB's Source Code on Openshift:

Go back to `your web console <https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/applications>`_ and then click NodeBB application. Copy the URL address from "Scoure Code."

A similar scoure code URL address should be this: ssh://[code]@nodebb-[namespace].rhcloud.com/~/git/nodebb.git/

Go back to terminal. Paste the following command and then paste the URL address.

.. code:: bash

	git clone ssh://[code]@nodebb-[namespace].rhcloud.com/~/git/nodebb.git/

Note: If it exists, check to make sure you do not have more than four files. If it is, delete it and rerun the command. Otherwise continue on.

Note: This will create NodeBB folder on your computer, usually ~/users/[name]/NodeBB

Then cd to NodeBB folder on your computer. And you will need to clone NodeBB from Github to your application by using this command. The default command git clone will not work with Openshift, unless you're in SSH. You may split up this command into two parts if you needed to clone your repository to another part of your computer start git bash from there.

.. code:: bash

	cd nodebb && git remote add upstream -m master https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB.git

or

.. code:: bash

	cd nodebb
	git remote add upstream -m master https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB.git


Then pull files from NodeBB's repository.

.. code:: bash

	git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream v0.9.x

Openshift does not yet support version `1.0.0` or later, see `this issue on github <https://github.com/ahwayakchih/openshift-nodebb/issues/17>`_.

**Step 5:** Upload the source code to Openshift

Now you will need to commit and push files to your application's repository. Replace `message` with your message. It will take a while to finish.

.. code:: bash

	git commit -a -m 'message' && git push

**Step 6:** Configure and Install NodeBB.

SSH back into your application:

.. code:: bash

	rhc app ssh -a nodebb

Start the installation of NodeBB using interactive installer. You're going to fill in your application's details.

.. code:: bash

	cd ~/app-root/repo && ./nodebb setup

Note: Web installer (npm start) might will not work because... it's Openshift.

*URL used to access this NodeBB (http://localhost:4567)* - Copy and paste your application's URL address and then add port 8080 like so: http://nodebb-[namespace].rhcloud.com:8080

*Please enter a NodeBB secret (code)* - Just press enter.

*Which database to use (redis)* - enter `mongo`.

*Host IP or address of your Mongo instance (127.0.0.1)* - Copy & paste Mongo's IP address.

*Host port of your Mongo instance (6379)* - Copy & paste Mongo's port.

*Password of your Mongo database* - Enter your Mongo password.

*Which database to use (0)* - Enter the database name.

**Step 7:** Now you will need to edit config.json NodeBB had created. Paste the following command.

.. code:: bash

	nano config.json

Add a line below "url" and then add the following. Repleace NodeJS IP Address to IP address of your application. Then exit the editor using CTRL+X.
 
```
"bind_address": "NodeJS IP Address",
```

**Step 8:** Now start your NodeBB on Openshift! And you're done! Then visit your website: http://nodebb-[namespace].rhcloud.com/

.. code:: bash

	cd ~/app-root/repo && ./nodebb start

Note
---------------------------------------
Starting, stopping, reloading, or restarting NodeBB now works on Openshift. Be sure you always do this before doing it. (Replace `[string]` with a nodeBB command of your choice). You can recover your application from critical plugin failures for example by running ./nodebb stop followed by ./nodebb reset -p nodebb-plugin-name

.. code:: bash

	rhc app ssh -a nodebb
	cd ~/app-root/repo
	./nodebb [string]

If you application fails to start after a git push due to an error like EADDRINUSE openshift's application has critically failed and you may want to consider moving your application to a new instance. Look up backing up and exporting databases. You can still resolve the error by first force stopping your application before making a push, but you will have to do this every single git push from now on.

.. code:: bash

	rhc app-force-stop -a nodebb
	git push origin master
